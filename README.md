# THIS IS NOT A PLUGIN. THIS IS A STANDALONE APP
You have to run it like an exe file

## Requirements:
- Java 17+ on the system

## Description:
This application allows you to easily translate plugins language files.
Choose input yaml file, select the source language (in the example english) and pick the destination language (in the example French)

The app will not translate
- Minecraft font formatting (&1)
- Html like formatting (<tag>)
but will keep the original style, so you don't have to

Set the options
- Ignore param formatting will not translate words wrapped by
  - %word %word% 
  - {word}
  - [word]
  - #word #word# 
- Minifont will change all the chars in the string (ignoring formatting) to the minifont style 
  - ǫᴡᴇʀᴛʏᴜɪᴏᴘᴀsᴅғɢʜᴊᴋʟᴢxᴄᴠʙɴᴍ

You can use the app also to only change the font of language file to minifont. Just set the Translate from and Translate to as the same value.
